# DSA Journey 🚀

Hi, I’m Deepesh, a CSE student starting my journey in
Data Structures & Algorithms.

This repository documents my learning:
- Basic DSA problems (C++)
- Logic-building exercises

### Current Focus
- DSA in C++ (patterns, arrays, basics)
- Learning through hackathons and team projects

This repo will grow with time.
Consistency > Perfection.
